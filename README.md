# SmartPot
A super smart Pot!!!
# description
This is a smart flower pot that uses multiple sensors to determine how healthy the plant is and if you need to water it again. Specifically we are using a DHT11 sensor for humidity and temperature and a motion sensor in the are where you need to water the plant, to determine when the last time is when you watered it and if you need to water it again. If the motion sensor will not be set of for a set amount of time, the 3 speaker with audio amps will be set off and they will make a very unpleasent sound. The health of the plant and the data from the sensors is shown on a touch screen. The flower pot is powered by 2 usb-c cables.
# design
We fully designed the flower pot and 3d printed it. Itâ€™s designed to distribute water evenly to the plant. It consist of 3 main parts, the pot itself (violett), the water distribution system (blue) and the bottom which is going to be left out as the cables are being stored there. We also have a scrren holder that we glued to the pot (blue on the outside)

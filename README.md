# SmartPot
A super smart Pot!!!
# description
This is a smart flower pot that uses multiple sensors to determine how healthy the plant is and if you need to water it again. Specifically we are using a DHT11 sensor for humidity and temperature and a motion sensor in the are where you need to water the plant, to determine when the last time is when you watered it and if you need to water it again. If the motion sensor will not be set of for a set amount of time, the 3 speaker with audio amps will be set off and they will make a very unpleasent sound. The health of the plant and the data from the sensors is shown on a touch screen.
